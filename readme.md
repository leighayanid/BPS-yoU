<hr>

BPS-yoU is a forum web application developed for the students and alumni of Bataan Peninsula State University similar to web-based forum application like StackOverflow and PinoyExchange.

- Basic Authentication
- Social Media Authentication using Facebook, Twitter, Github or Google
- Create, read, update, delete a thread
- Replying to a thread
- Commenting to a thread
- Upvote/downvote a thread
- Like/Unlike feature

<h3>Technology Stack</h3>
- HTML5, CSS, jQuery
