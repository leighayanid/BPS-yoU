<hr>

BPS-yoU is a forum web application developed for the students and alumni of Bataan Peninsula State University similar to web-based forum application like StackOverflow and PinoyExchange. I believe every student or alumnus of this institution must voice their opinion about certain topics or issues that are happening within the school.

## Features of the project are the following:
- Basic Authentication
- Social Media Authentication using Facebook, Twitter, Github or Google
- Create, read, update, delete a thread
- Replying to a thread
- Commenting to a thread
- Upvote/downvote a thread
- Like/Unlike feature

## Technology Stack
- HTML5, CSS, jQuery
- Laravel
- Laravel Socialite
- MySQL
- Laragon
